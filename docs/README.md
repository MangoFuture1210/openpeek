# OpenGlance documentation

The repository root contains the standard open-source entry points: `README.md`, `LICENSE`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. Maintainer-facing technical documents use English
as their single source. End-user documents may add a `.zh-CN` counterpart where a second language
materially improves installation, privacy, or product use.

Repository-specific agent rules remain in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Contribution and vulnerability
reporting guidance remain in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

The public User Guide Demo and this source repository are intentionally complementary. Stable
user-facing walkthroughs, main-feature examples, and screenshot content belong in the demo repository;
technical contracts, release schemas, security probes, and regression-only fixtures stay here.
Whenever a stable user-visible capability, workflow, or screenshot scenario changes, review the
matching demo page in the same maintenance cycle. Copied or adapted pages record their upstream source
path and revision so the demo cannot silently become a second authority.
